This is the tutorial I did much of my early leanring on. The files are numbered by the lesson number as well as the section number.
Section 3-4 is HTML basic.
Section 4-6 has CSS basics.
Section 7 is on Bootstrap.
Section 8-15 has JavaScript content.
Section 16-17 is jquery

The remainder of the course is "BackEnd". I am not decided if I will complete that yet.
